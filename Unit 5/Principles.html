    <h3>Principles of Heredity</h3>
    <p>Mendel’s experiments allowed him to develop two fundamental principles of heredity:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The law of segregation</li>
            <li>
                The law of independent assortment
                </li>
    </ul>
    <b>Mendel's Model</b>
    <p>Mendel performed the same crosses for each of the seven characteristics of pea plants and found the same results</p>
    <ul><li>He found that the F2 generation was always a 3:1 ratio</li></ul>

    <p>To explain the 3:1 ratio he observed in the F2 generation, Mendel created a model with four concepts:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Alternative versions of genes (alleles) account for variations in inherited characteristics</li>
        <li>For each characteristic, an organism inherits two copies (two alleles) of a gene, one from each parent.</li>
        <li>If two alleles at a locus differ, then the dominant allele determines the appearance and the recessive allele has no noticeable effect</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Law of segregation</b>: the two alleles for the same trait separate during gamete formation and end up in different gametes</p>
    <p><b>Law of Independent Assortment</b></p>
    <p>Mendel’s second principle is the law of independent assortment: genes for one trait are not inherited with genes of another trait</p>
    <ul><li>Instead of following one trait in his crosses, this time Mendel followed two traits (i.e. pea pod color and pea pod shape)</li></ul>
    <p>This law only applies to: genes that are located on different chromosomes (not homologous) OR genes that are very far apart on the same chromosome</p>
