    <h3>Sex-Linked Genes</h3>
    <p>Sex-linked gene: a gene located on either the X or the Y chromosome</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Y-linked genes: genes specifically found on the Y chromosome</li>
        <ul><li>Very few Y-linked genes, so very few disorders</li></ul>
        <li>X-linked genes: genes found on the X chromosome</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Inheritance of X-Linked Genes    </b>
    <p>Fathers can pass X-linked alleles to all of their daughters, but none of their sons.</p>
    <p>
        Mothers can pass X-linked alleles to both daughters and sons</p>
    <p>If an X-linked trait is due to a recessive allele:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Females will only express trait if they are homozygous</li>
        <li>Because males only have one X chromosome, they will express the trait if they inherit it from their mother</li>
        <ul>
            <li>They are called <b>hemizygous</b> (since the term heterozygous does not apply)</li>
            <li>Due to this males are much more likely to have an X-linked disorder</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <b>X-Linked Disorders</b>
    <p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy - Progressive weakening of muscles
        </p>
    <p>Hemophilia - Inability to properly clot blood
       </p>
    <p> Color blindness - Inability to correctly see colors</p>
    <b>X-Inactivation</b>
    <p>Females inherit two X chromosomes, which is double than males!</p>
    <p>During development, most of the X chromosome in each cell becomes inactive</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The inactive X in each cell of a female condenses into a <b>Barr body</b></li>
        <ul><li>Helps to regulate gene dosage in females</li></ul>
    </ul>
