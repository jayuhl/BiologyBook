    <h3>Linked Genes    </h3>
    <p>Linked genes: genes located near each other on the same chromosome that tend to be inherited together</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Meiosis and random fertilization generate genetic variation in offspring due to:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Independent assortment of chromosomes</li>
            <li>Crossing over in Meiosis I</li>
            <li>Any sperm can fertilize any egg</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Crossing Over</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Linked genes show parental phenotypes in offspring at higher than 50%</li>
        <li>During crossing over chromosomes from one paternal chromatid and one maternal chromatid exchange corresponding segments</li>
        <li>Crossing over helps to explain why some linked genes become separated during meiosis</li>
        <li>
            The further apart two genes are on the same chromosome, the higher the probability that a crossing over event will occur between them and the higher the recombination frequency</li>
    </ul>
