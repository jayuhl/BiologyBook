    <h3>Meiosis Overview</h3>
    <p>Meiosis: a process that creates haploid gamete cells in sexually reproducing diploid organisms</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Results in daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Example: humans</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Diploid: 2n= 46</li>
                    <li>
                        Meiosis produces sperm and eggs that are haploid: n=23
                        </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Involves two rounds of division</li>
        <ul><li>Meiosis I and Meiosis II</li></ul>
    </ul>
    <p>There are three key events in meiosis that are unique:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Prophase I: synapsis and crossing over</li>
        <li>
            Metaphase I: tetrads (homologous pairs) line up at the metaphase plate</li>
        <li>
            Anaphase I: homologous pairs separate</li>
        </ol>
    <p>Meiosis followed by fertilization ensures genetic diversity in sexually reproducing organisms and provides genetic variation that plays a role in natural selection.</p>
    <p>This cellular process is driven by the interaction of subcellular components and uses free energy that is required for the growth and reproduction of living systems
