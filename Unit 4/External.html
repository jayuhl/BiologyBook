    <h3>External Cell Cycle Regulators</h3>
    <p><b>Growth factors</b>: hormones released by cells that stimulate cell growth</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Signal transduction pathway is initiated</li>
        <ul><li> 
            CDKs are activated leading to progression through the cell cycle</li></ul>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Contact (or density) inhibition</b>: Cell surface receptors recognize contact with other cells</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Initiates signal transduction pathway that stops the cell cycle in G1 phase</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Anchorage dependence</b>: cells rely on attachment to other cells or the extracellular matrix to divide</p>
