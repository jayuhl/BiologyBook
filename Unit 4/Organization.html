    <h3>Organization of DNA</h3>
    <p>Cells must organize and package their DNA before division</p>
    <ul>
        <li>DNA associates with and wraps around proteins known as histones to form nucleosomes</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Strings of nucleosomes form chromatin</li>
            <ul>
                <li>When a cell is not actively dividing, chromatin is in a non-condensed form</li>
                <li>After DNA replication, chromatin condenses to form a chromosome</li>
                <ul><li>Chromosomes are densely packed to allow for easier division</li></ul>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Since the DNA was replicated, each chromosome has a duplicated copy</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The copies join together to form sister chromatids</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Centromere: the region on each sister chromatid where they are most closely attached</li>
            <li>Kinetochore: proteins attached to the centromere that link each sister chromatid to the mitotic spindle</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
