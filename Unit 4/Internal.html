    <h3>Internal Cell Cycle Regulators</h3>
    <p>Regulation of the cell cycle involves an internal control system that consists of:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Proteins known as <b>cyclins</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Concentration of cyclins varies </li>
            <ul><li>
                Cyclins are synthesized and degraded at specific stages of the cell cycle</li></ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Enzymes known as <b>cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Concentration remains constant through each phase of the cell cycle</li>
            <ul><li>
                Active only when its specific cyclin is present</li></ul>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>Each cyclin-CDK complex has a specific regulatory effect</p>
    <ul><li>Active CDK complexes phosphorylate target proteins, which help regulate key events in the cell cycle</li></ul>
