    <h3>Allosteric Regulation</h3>
    <p>Allosteric enzymes have <u>two</u> binding sites</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 active site</li>
        <li> 1 allosteric site (regulatory site, site other than the active site)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Allosteric Regulation: molecules bind (noncovalent interactions) to an allosteric site which changes the shape and function of the active site</p>
<ul><li>May result in inhibition (by an inhibitor) or stimulation (by an activator) of the enzymes activity</li></ul>

<b>Allosteric activator: </b><span>substrate binds to allosteric site and stabilizes the shape of the enzyme so that the active sites remain open</span>
<br><br>
<b>Allosteric Inhibitor: </b><span>substrate binds to allosteric site and stabilizes the enzyme shape so that the active sites are closed (inactive form)</span>
<br><br>

<br>
<b>Cooperativity: </b><span>ubstrate binds to one active site (on an enzyme with more than one active site) which stabilizes the active form</span>
<ul><li>Considered allosteric regulation since binding at one site changes the shape of other sites</li></ul>
