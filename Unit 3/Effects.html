    <h3>Environmental Effects on Enzymes</h3>
    <p>Enzymes are <u>proteins</u>, which means their 3-D shape can be affected by different factors.</p>
    <p>The efficiency of enzymes can be affected by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Temperature</li>
        <li>pH</li>
        <li>Chemicals</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Optimal conditions allow for enzymes to function to most efficiently.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The rate of enzyme activity <u>increases</u> with temperature (due to collisions) up to a certain point.</li>
        <ul><li>After a certain point, the enzyme will denature.</li></ul>
        <li>Enzymes function best at a specific pH.</li>
        <ul><li>Being outside the normal pH range can cause hydrogen bonds in the enzyme to break, changing the shape of the enzyme.</li></ul>
    </ul>
