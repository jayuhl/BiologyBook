    <h3>Genetic Drift</h3>
    <p>Genetic drift: chance events that cause a change in allele frequency from one generation to the next</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Most significant to small populations</li>
        <li>Can lead to a loss of genetic variation</li>
        <li>Can cause harmful alleles to become fixed</li>
        <li>Does NOT produce adaptations</li>
        <li>Two types:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Bottleneck Effect</li>
            <li>Founder Effect</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <b>Bottleneck Effect    </b>
    <p>Bottleneck effect: when a large population is drastically reduced by a <u>non-selective disaster</u></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Floods, famine, fires, hurricanes, hunting, etc.</li>
        <li>Some alleles may become overrepresented, underrepresented, or absent</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Founder Effect    </b>
    <p>Founder effect: when a few individuals become isolated from a large population and establish a new small population with a gene pool that differs from the large population</p>
    <ul><li>Lose genetic diversity</li></ul>
