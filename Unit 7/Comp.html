    <h3>Comparative Morphology    </h3>
    <p>Comparative morphology: analysis of the structures of living and extinct organisms</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Homology: characteristics in related species that have similarities even if the functions differ</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Embryonic homology: many species have similar embryonic development
            </li>
            <li>Vestigial structures: structures that are conserved even though they no longer have a use</li>
            <li>Molecular homology: many species share similar DNA and amino acid sequences</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Homologous structures</b>:  characteristics that are similar in two species because they share a common ancestor</p>
    <ul><li>Example: arm bones of many species</li></ul>
    <p><b>Convergent evolution</b>: similar adaptations that have evolved in distantly related organisms due to similar environments</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Analogous structures</b>: structures that are similar but have separate evolutionary origins</li>
        <ul><li>Example: wings in birds vs bats vs bees â†’ Each species have wings, but the wings did not originate from a common ancestor</li></ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Structural evidence indicates common ancestry of all eukaryotes</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Many fundamental and cellular features and processes are conserved across organisms</li>
        <ul><li>Cellular examples:
            Membrane-bound organelles, 
            Linear chromosomes, 
            Introns in genes
            </li></ul>
    </ul>
