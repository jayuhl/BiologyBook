    <h3>Cladograms</h3>
    <p>Each line represents a lineage</p>
    <p>Each branching point is a node</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Nodes</b> represent <u>common ancestor</u></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Nodes and all branches from it are called clades</li>
            <li>
                Species in a clade have shared derived features
                </li>
        </ul>
        <li>The <b>root</b> is the common ancestor of all the species</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Two clades that emerge from the same node are <b>sister taxa</b></p>
    <p>A lineage that evolved from the root and remains unbranched is the <b>basal taxon</b></p>
    <p><b>Synapomorphy</b>: a derived character shared by clade members</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Derived characteristic</b>: similarity inherited from the most recent common ancestor of an entire group
            </li>
        <li><b>Ancestral characteristic</b>: similarity that arose prior to the common ancestor</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many cladograms and trees include an <b>outgroup</b></p>
    <ul><li>
        A lineage that is the least closely related to the rest of the organisms
        </li></ul>
    <p>If there are conflicts among characters, use the <b>principle of parsimony</b></p>
    <ul><li>Use the hypothesis that requires the fewest assumptions (DNA changes)</li></ul>
