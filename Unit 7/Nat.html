    <h3>Natural Selection</h3>
    <p>Natural selection: A process in which individuals that have certain traits tend to <b>survive and reproduce</b> at higher rates than other individuals because of those traits</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Natural selection acts on phenotypic variations in populations</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Some phenotypes will increase or decrease an organism’s <b>fitness</b> (ability to survive and reproduce)</li>
            <ul><li>Measured by reproductive success</li></ul>
            <li>Environments can change, causing selective pressures to populations</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>The theory of natural selection is based on two main observations that Darwin made:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Traits are heritable</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Characteristics can be passed from parent to offspring</li>
            <li>Adaptations: inherited characteristics of organisms that enhance their survival and reproduction</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>More offspring are produced than can survive</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>This leads to competition for limited resources, which results in differential survival</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The traits that lead to survival (“favorable” traits) will accumulate in the population</li>
                <ul><li><b>Populations evolve, NOT individuals</b></li></ul>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ol>
