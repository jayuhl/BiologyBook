    <h3>Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium    </h3>
    <p>A model used to assess whether natural selection or other factors are causing evolution at a particular locus</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Determines what the genetic make up of the population would be if it were NOT evolving</li>
        <ul>
            <li>This is then compared to actual data:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If there are NO differences, then the population is NOT evolving</li>
                <li>
                    If there ARE differences, then the population MAY BE evolving</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><b>The Hardy Weinberg Principle:</b>
        the frequencies of alleles and genotypes in a population will remain constant 
        from generation to generation, provided that only Mendelian segregation and recombination of alleles 
        are at work</p>
    <p>Remember: this is a hypothetical situation where no evolution would take place. In real populations the allele and genotype frequencies DO change over time</p>
    <p>Five conditions must be met to be in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>No mutations</li>
        <li>Random mating</li>
        <li>No natural selection</li>
        <li>Extremely large population size</li>
        <li>No gene flow</li>
    </ol>
    <span>If any of these conditions are not met, then microevolution occurs (i.e. mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, natural selection, and non-random mating).</span>
