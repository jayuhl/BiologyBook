    <h3>Modes of Natural Selection</h3>
    <p>Reproductive success is measured by <b>relative fitness</b></p>
    <ul><li>The number of surviving offspring that an individual produces compared to the number left by others in the population</li></ul>
    <p>Effects of natural selection can be measured by examining the changes in the mean of phenotypes</p>
    <ul>
        <li>There are three <u>modes</u> of natural selection</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Directional selection</li>
            <ul><li>Selection towards one extreme phenotype</li></ul>
            <li>Stabilizing selection</li>
            <ul><li>Selection towards the mean and against the extreme phenotypes</li></ul>
            <li>Disruptive selection</li>
            <ul><li>Selection against the mean. Both phenotypic extremes have the highest relative fitness</li></ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Sexual selection</b>: a type of natural selection that explains why many species have unique/showy traits</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Males often have useless structures (ie colorful male peacock feathers) simply because females choose that trait</li>
        <li>Can produce traits that are harmful to survival</li>
        <ul><li>Example: colorful feathers in male peacocks make them easier to spot by predators</li></ul>
    </ul>
