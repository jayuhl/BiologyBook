    <h3>Postzygotic Barriers</h3>
    <p>Postzygotic barriers: prevent a hybrid zygote from developing into a viable, fertile adult</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Three types:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Reduced hybrid viability
                </li>
            <li>Reduced hybrid fertility
                </li>
            <li>Hybrid breakdown
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Reduced hybrid viability</b>: The genes of different parent species may interact in ways that impair the hybridâ€™s development or survival
</p>
    <ul><li>        Example: domestic sheep can fertilize domestic goats, but the hybrid embryo dies early on</li></ul>
    <p><b>Reduced hybrid fertility</b>: a hybrid can develop into a healthy adult, but it is sterile
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>        Usually results due to differences in number of chromosomes between parents</li>
        <ul><li>
            Example: a male donkey and a female horse can mate to produce a mule, but mules are sterile</li></ul>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Hybrid breakdown</b>: the hybrid of the first generation may be fertile, but when they mate with a parent species or one another, their offspring will be sterile
</p>
    <ul><li>        Example: farmers have tried crossing different types of cotton plants, but after the first generation the plants do not produce viable seeds</li></ul>
    <p></p>
