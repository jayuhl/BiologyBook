    <h3>Variations in Populations    </h3>
    <p>The <b>more</b> genetic diversity in a population, the <b>better</b> it can respond to changes in the environment</p>
    <ul>
        <li>More likely to be individuals that can withstand changes</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Species with low genetic diversity are at risk of decline and/or <b>extinction</b></li>
            <ul><li>Example: due to poaching and poisoning, the California Condor was reduced to 27 individuals. This drastically lowered the gene pool. Even though restoration efforts have increased numbers, they have lost diversity</li></ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
