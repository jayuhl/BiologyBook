    <h3>Population Dynamics</h3>
    <p>Populations are influenced by natural selection and environmental factors.</p>
    <p><b>Life history</b>: the traits that affect an organismâ€™s schedule of reproduction and survival</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Three variables affect life history:</li>
        <ol>
            <li><b>When</b> reproduction begins</li>
            <li>
                <b>How often</b> the organism can reproduce</li>
            <li>
                The <b>number</b> of offspring produced per reproductive episode</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>

    <p><b>K-selection (density-dependent selection)</b>: selection for life history traits that are sensitive to population density</p>
    <ul><li>Seen in high density populations that are close to carrying capacity (K)</li></ul>
    <p><b>R-selection (density independent selection)</b>: selection for life history traits that maximize reproductive success</p>
    <ul><li>Seen in low density populations with little competition</li></ul>
    <p><b>Density-dependent regulation</b>: as a population increases, factors can slow or stop growth by decreasing birth rate and increasing death rate</p>
    <ul><li>Competition, predation, toxic wastes, territoriality, disease, intrinsic factors (ie reproduction rates)</li></ul>
    <p><b>Density-independent regulation</b>: factors that exert their influence on population size, but the birth/death rate of a population does not change</p>
    <ul><li>Weather, climate, natural disasters</li></ul>
