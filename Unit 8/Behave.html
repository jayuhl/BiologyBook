    <h3>Behavioral Ecology</h3>
    <p>In the 1970s a group of scientists won the Nobel Prize in Physiology for their discoveries concerning organization and elicitation of individual and social behavior patterns</p>
    <ul><li>These studies developed the discipline of <b>ethology</b></li>
        <ul><li><b>Ethology</b>: the study of how evolutionary processes shape inherited behaviors and the ways that animals respond to specific stimuli</li></ul>
        </ul>
    
    <p><b>Behavior</b>: an animal’s response to a stimulus (internal or external)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Nature vs nurture (genetic and environmental factors)</li>
        <li>Allow for survival and reproduction</li>
        <ul><li>Subject to natural selection</li></ul>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Understanding Behavior    </b></p>
    <p><b>Proximate cause</b>: <u>how</u> a behavior occurs or how it is modified</p>
    <ol>
        <li>What was the stimulus to cause the behavior?
            </li>
        <li>How does the “nurture” component affect behavior? (how do the experiences during growth and development influence the response)
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Ultimate cause</b>: <u>why</u> a behavior occurs (in context of natural selection)</p>
    <ol>
        <li>How does the behavior help the animal survive and reproduce?
            </li>
        <li>How does the “nature” component affect behavior? (what is the evolutionary basis of the behavior)
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Behavior can be <b>innate</b> or <b>learned</b></p>
