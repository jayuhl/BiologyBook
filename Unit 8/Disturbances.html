    <h3>Disturbances</h3>
    <p>Disturbances can also influence species diversity and composition</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Disturbance: an event that changes a community by removing organisms from it or altering resource availability
            </li>
        <ul><li>Fires, droughts, human activities, etc.</li></ul>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Ecological succession</b>: the gradual process by which the species composition of a community changes and develops over time after a disturbance</p>
    <ul><li>Primary succession: a series of changes on an entirely new (previously lifeless) habitat that has not been colonized</li>
        <li>Secondary succession: a series of changes that clears an existing community, but leaves the soil intact</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Human Disturbance</b></p>
    <p>Human activity is the strongest disturbance to an ecosystem</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The main threats to biodiversity are:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Habitat loss</li>
            <li>
                Invasive species</li>
            <li>
                Overharvesting</li>
            <li>
                Global change
                </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Habitat loss</b>: single greatest threat to biodiversity</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Agricultural development and urbanization
            </li>
        <ul><li>Clear cutting, cattle grazing, farmland</li></ul>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Invasive species</b>: a nonnative species that can occupy a wide range of habitats and competitively exclude native species from those habitats</p>
    <p><b>Overharvesting</b>: organisms are harvested faster than their population can rebound</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Harvesting of ivory in elephants (now banned)
            </li>
        <li>Overfishing
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Global change</b>: alterations to climate, atmospheric chemistry, and ecological systems that reduce the capacity of Earth to sustain life</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Air/water pollution</li>
        <ul><li>Acid rain</li></ul>
        <li>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</li>
        <li>Ocean acidification</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Human disturbances have led to a significant increase in the number of <b>endangered species</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Many species that are now threatened could potentially provide food, medicine, and fibers
            </li>
        <li>Scientists believe we are currently in a mass extinction
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Biogeographical Factors    </b></p>
    <p>Biogeographical factors: large scale factors that contribute to a range of diversity observed</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Latitude: species are more diverse in tropics than at the poles due to climate</li>
        <li>Area: larger areas are more diverse because they offer greater diversity of habitats</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Pathogens</b></p>
    <p>Pathogens: disease causing organisms and viruses</p>
    <ul><li>Pathogens have the most effect on new habitats or ecosystems with less biodiversity</li></ul>
