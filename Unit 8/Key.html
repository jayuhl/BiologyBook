    <h3>Keystone Species    </h3>
    <p>Some species play a more pivotal role than others in a community</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Keystone species: not usually abundant, but other species in an ecosystem rely on them because of their important ecological niches</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Example: coral</li>
            <ul><li>
                Coral reefs serve as a keystone species because many other organisms rely upon it as a source of food and protection
                </li></ul>
            <li>Example: honey bees</li>
            <ul><li>
                Bees are a keystone species because they serve as pollinators
                </li></ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Keystone species, producers, and essential abiotic and biotic factors contribute to maintaining the diversity of the ecosystem</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If keystone species were to be removed from an ecosystem it would have a rippling effect</li>
        <ul><li>Often ecosystems collapse</li></ul>
    </ul>
