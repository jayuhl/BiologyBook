    <h3>Ecosystems and Energy    </h3>
    <p>Ecosystem: the sum of all the organisms living in a given area and the abiotic factors they interact with</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Biotic factors: living, or once living, components of an environment</li>
        <li>
            Abiotic factors: nonliving (physical and chemical properties of the environment)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A <b>net gain</b> in energy results in energy <b>storage or growth</b> of an organism</p>
    <p>A <b>net loss</b> of energy results in <b>loss of mass and eventual death</b> of an organism</p>
    <p><b>Metabolic Rate    </b></p>
    <p>Metabolic rate: the total amount of energy an animal uses in a unit of time</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Can be measured in calories, heat loss, or by the amount of oxygen consumed (or CO2 produced)</li>
        <ul><li>Oxygen is used in cellular respiration and CO2 is produced as a by-product </li></ul>
        <li>An animalâ€™s metabolic rate is related to its body mass</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Smaller organisms = higher metabolic rate
                </li>
            <li>Larger organisms = lower metabolic rate
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Organisms use different strategies to regulate body temperature</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Endotherms</b>: use thermal energy from metabolism to maintain body temperatures</li>
        <li><b>Ectotherms</b>: use external sources (ie sun/shade or other organisms) to regulate their body temperature</li>
    </ul>
