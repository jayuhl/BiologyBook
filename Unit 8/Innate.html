    <h3>Innate Behaviors</h3>
    <p>Innate behaviors: developmentally fixed</p>
    <ul>
        <li> 
            Hereditary, born behaviors, do not need to learn them; instinctive
           </li>
        <li> Experience during growth has no obvious effect</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Fixed action patterns (FAPs)</b>: a sequence of unlearned acts directly linked to a stimulus</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Actions are <u>unchangeable</u></li>
        <li>
            Carried out to completion</li>
        <li>
            Triggered by a <u>sign stimulus</u> (external cue)</li>
            <ul><li>Example: stickleback fish</li></ul>
    </ul>
    <p><u>Example: </u></p>
    <p>Male stickleback fish have bright, red bellies, unlike their female counterparts who have 
        silver bellies. Male stickleback fish are highly territorial and will attack other males who enter 
        their territory. When male sticklebacks see the color red (their sign stimulus) they become aggressive. 
        In fact, it doesn’t even have to be another male fish, anytime they see the color red, 
        they become highly irritated, aggressive, and attack.    </p>
    <p><b>Migration</b>: a regular, long-distance change in location</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Triggered by environmental cues</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Sun's position</li>
            <li>Earth’s magnetic field
            </li>
        <li>Celestial cues
        </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Signal</b>: a stimulus generated and transmitted from one animal to another; animal communication</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Examples: visual, auditory, tactile, electrical,chemical</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Pheromones: chemicals emitted by members of a species that can affect other members of the same species</li>
            <li>Stimulus response chains: when a response to a stimulus serves as the next stimulus for a behavior</li>
            <li>Body movement</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><u>Example:</u></p>
    <p>In the early 1900s, it was discovered that honeybees communicate through body movements that resemble dancing. 
        Today, it is known as the <b>waggle dance</b>. Worker bees will gather around a bee that has returned to the 
        hive after foraging. The returned bee will shake its abdomen and form a figure-eight shape to tell other bees 
        the direction where food can be found.     </p>
    <p><b>Directed movements</b>: movements towards or away from a stimulus</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Kinesis</b>: a change in the rate of movement or the frequency of turning movements in response to a stimulus; non directional</li>
        <li><b>Taxis</b>: directional movement towards (positive) or away from (negative) a stimulus</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Phototaxis: movement in response to light
                </li>
            <li>Chemotaxis: movement in response to chemical signals
               </li>
            <li> Geotaxis: movement in response to gravity</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
