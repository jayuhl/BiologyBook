    <h3>Responses in Plants    </h3>
    <p>Since photosynthesis is critical to a plantâ€™s survival, plants can respond to light</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Phototropism</b>: a directional response that allows plants to grow towards (and in some cases away from) a source of light</li>
        <li><b>Photoperiodism</b>: allows plants to develop in response to day length; plants flower only at certain times of the year</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Plants also have mechanisms of defending themselves against herbivory:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Physical defenses: thorns, trichomes (small plant like hairs)</li>
        <li>Chemical defenses: production of toxic or distasteful compounds</li>
        <li>Example: lima bean plants that are being damaged release volatile chemicals that surrounding lima bean plants can sense, causing them to release compounds making themselves less susceptible to herbivory</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Soil composition can affect plants</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The pH of soil can affect flower coloring in some plants        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Nutrients are more accessible at certain pH</li>
            
        </ul>
        <li>Example: hydrangea blooms turn different colors based upon soil pH (blue-pH 5, pink- pH 7)</li>
    </ul>
