    <h3>Steps in DNA Replication</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>DNA replication begins at sites called <b>origins of replication</b></li>
        <ul><li>Various proteins attach to the origin of replication and open the DNA to form a <b>replication fork</b></li></ul>
        <li><b>Helicase</b> will unwind the DNA strands at each replication fork</li>
        <ul>
            <li>To keep the DNA from re-bonding with itself, proteins called single strand binding proteins (SSBPs) bind to the DNA to keep it open</li>
            <li><b>Topoisomerase</b> will help prevent strain ahead of the replication fork by relaxing supercoiling</li>
        </ul>

        <li>The enzyme primase initiates replication by adding short segments of RNA, called primers, to the parental DNA strand</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The enzymes that synthesize DNA can only attach new DNA nucleotides to an existing strand of nucleotides</li>
            <li>Primers serve as the foundation for DNA synthesis</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Antiparallel elongation</li>
        <ul>
            <li><b>DNA Polymerase III</b> (DNAP III) attaches to each primer on the parental strand and moves in the <b>3’ to 5’</b> direction</li>
            <ul>
                <li>As it moves, it adds nucleotides to the new strand in the 5’ to 3’ direction</li>
                <li>The DNAP III that follows helicase is known as the <b>leading</b> strand and it only requires one primer</li>
                <li>The DNAP III on the other parental strand that moves away from helicase is known as the <b>lagging</b> strand and requires <u>many</u> primers</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>The leading strand is synthesized in one continuous segment, but since the lagging strand moves away from the replication fork it is synthesized in chunks</li>
        <ul><li>Okazaki fragments: segments of the lagging strand</li></ul>
        <li>After DNAP III forms an okazaki fragment, DNAP I replaces RNA nucleotides with DNA nucleotides</li>
        <ul><li><b>DNA ligase</b>: joins the okazaki fragments forming a continuous DNA strand</li></ul>
    </ol>
