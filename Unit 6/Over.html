    <h3>Translation Overview</h3>
    <p>Translation: the synthesis of a polypeptide using information from the mRNA.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Occurs at the ribosome</li>
        <li>
            A nucleotide sequence becomes an amino acid sequence</li>
    </ul>
    <p>tRNA is a key player in translating mRNA to an amino acid sequence.</p>
    <b>Transfer RNA    </b>
    <p>tRNA has an <b>anticodon</b> region which is <b>complementary and antiparallel</b> to mRNA</p>
    <p>tRNA carries the amino acid that the mRNA codon codes for</p>
    <ul><li>ACU codes for Thr</li></ul>
    <p>The enzyme aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase is responsible for attaching amino acids to tRNA</p>
    <ul><li>When tRNA carries an amino acid it is “charged”</li></ul>
    <b>Ribosomes    </b>
    <p>Translation occurs at the ribosome</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Ribosomes have two subunits: small and large
            </li>
        <li>Prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomal subunits differ in size
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Prokaryotes: small subunit (30s) large subunit (40s)
                </li>
            <li>Eukaryotes: small subunit (40s) large subunit (60s)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>The large subunit has three sites: A, P, and E</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A site: amino acid site</li>
        <ul><li>
            Holds the next tRNA carrying an amino acid
            </li></ul>
        <li>P site: polypeptide site</li>
        <ul><li>
            Holds the tRNA carrying the growing polypeptide chain
            </li></ul>
        <li>E site: exit site</li>
    </ul>
