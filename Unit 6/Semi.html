    <h3>Semi-Conservative Model</h3>
    <p>In 1954 Meselson and Stahl performed an experiment using bacteria. By analyzing samples of DNA after each generation, it was found that the parental strands were following the semi-conservative model.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The two parental strands each make a copy of itself
            </li>
            <ul><li>After one round of replication the two daughter molecules each have one parental and one new strand
            </li></ul>
    </ul>
