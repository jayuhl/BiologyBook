    <h3>Eukaryotic Gene Expression</h3>
    <p>The phenotype of a cell or organism is determined by a combination of genes that are expressed and the levels that they are expressed</p>
    <ul><li>Differences between cell types is known as <b>differential gene expression</b></li></ul>
    <p>Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated at different stages</p>
    <b>Chromatin structure:</b>
    <p>If DNA is tightly wound it is less accessible for transcription</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Histone acetylation</b> adds acetyl groups to histones, which loosens the DNA</li>
        <li>
            <b>DNA methylation</b> adds methyl groups to DNA, which causes the chromatin to condense</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Epigenetic inheritance:</b>
    <p>Chromatin modifications do not alter the nucleotide sequence of the DNA, but they can be heritable to future generations</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Modifications can be reversed, unlike mutations</li>
        <li>
            Explains why one identical twin may inherit a disease while the other does not</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Transcription initiation:</b>
    <p>Once chromatin modifications allow the DNA to be more accessible, specific transcription factors bind to control elements</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sections of non coding DNA that serve as binding sites</li>
        <li>
            Gene expression can be increased or decreased by binding of activators or repressors to control elements</li>
    </ul>
    <b>RNA processing:</b>
    <ul><li>Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA</li></ul>
    <b>Translation Initiation</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Translation can be activated or repressed by initiation factors</li>
        <li>
            MicroRNAs and small interfering RNAs can bind to mRNA and degrade it or block translation</li>
    </ul>
