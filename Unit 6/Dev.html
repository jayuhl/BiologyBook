    <h3>Eukaryotic Development</h3>
    <p>During embryonic development, cell division and cell differentiation occurs</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Cells become specialized in their structure and function</li>
            <li>
                Morphogenesis: the physical process that gives an organism its shape</li>
    </ul>
    <p>How do cells differentiate during early development?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Cytoplasmic determinants: substances in the maternal egg that influence cells
            </li>
            <li>Induction: cell to cell signals that can cause a change in gene expression</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both cytoplasmic determinants and induction influence pattern formation
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A “body plan” for the organism</li>
            <ul><li>
                Homeotic genes map out the body structures</li></ul>
        </ul>
    <p>As cells differentiate, apoptosis plays a critical role</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Apoptosis: programmed cell death</li>
        <ul>
            <li> 
                Allows structures to take their form</li>
                <ul><li>
                    Example: if apoptosis did not occur during the development of human hands and feet we would be born with webbed fingers and toe</li></ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
