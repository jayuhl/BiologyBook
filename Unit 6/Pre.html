    <h3>Pre-mRNA modifications</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>5’ cap (GTP)</b>: the 5’ end of the pre-mRNA receives a modified guanine nucleotide “cap”</li>
        <li><b>Poly-A tail</b>: the 3’ end of the pre-mRNA receives 50-250 adenine nucleotides</li>
        <p>Both the 5’ cap and the poly-A tail function to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Help the mature mRNA leave the nucleus
                </li>
            <li>Help protect the mRNA from degradation
               </li>
            <li> Help ribosomes attach to the 5’ end of the mRNA when it reaches the cytoplasm
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>RNA Splicing</b>: sections of the pre-mRNA, called introns, are removed and then exons are joined together</li>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Introns</u>: intervening sequence, do not code for amino acids
                </li>
            <li><u>Exons</u>: expressed sections, code for amino acids</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <b>Why does splicing occur?</b>
    <p>A single gene can code for more than one kind of polypeptide</p>
    <ul><li>Known as alternative splicing</li></ul>
    <p>Once all modifications have occurred, the pre-mRNA is now considered mature mRNA and can leave the nucleus and proceed to the cytoplasm for translation at the ribosomes</p>
