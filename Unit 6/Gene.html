    <h3>Bacterial Gene Expression    </h3>
    <p>Prokaryotes and eukaryotes must be able to regulate which genes are expressed at any given time.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Genes can be turned “on” or “off” based on environmental and internal cues</li>
        <ul><li>On/off refers to whether or not transcription will take place</li></ul>
        <li>Allows for cell specialization</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Operons</b>: a group of genes that can be turned on or off</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Operons have three parts:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Promoter</b>: where RNA polymerase can attach</li>
            <li>
                <b>Operator</b>: the on/off switch</li>
            <li>
                <b>Genes</b>: code for related enzymes in pathway</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Operons can be repressible or inducible</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Repressible (on to off): transcription is usually on, but can be repressed (stopped)</li>
            <li>
                Inducible (off to on): transcription is usually off, but can be induced (started)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Regulatory gene</b>: this type of gene produces a repressor protein that binds to the operator to block RNA polymerase from transcribing the gene</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Always expressed, but at low levels</li>
        <li>
            Binding of a repressor to an operator is reversible
            </li>
    </ul>
    <b>Repressible Operons    </b>
    <p>Example: the trp operon</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The trp operon in bacteria controls the synthesis of tryptophan</li>
        <li>Since it is repressible, transcription is active</li>
        <ul>
            <li>It can be switched off by a trp repressor</li>
            <ul><li>Allosteric enzyme that is only active when tryptophan binds to it</li></ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>When too much tryptophan builds up in bacteria, tryptophan is more likely to bind to the repressor turning it active, which will then temporarily shut off transcription for tryptophan</p>

    <b>Inducible Operon    </b>
    <p>Example: the lac operon</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The lac operon controls synthesis of lactase, an enzyme that digests lactose (milk sugar)</li>
        <li>Since it is inducible, transcription is off</li>
        <ul><li>A lac repressor is bound to the operator (allosterically active)</li></ul>
        <li>The inducer for the lac repressor is allolactose</li>
        <ul>
            <li>When present it will bind to the lac repressor  and turn the lac repressor off (allosterically inactive)</li>
            <ul><li>The genes can now be transcribed</li></ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
