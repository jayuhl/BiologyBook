    <h3>The Genetic Code</h3>
    <p>DNA contains the sequence of nucleotides that codes for proteins.</p>
    <ul><li>The sequence is read in groups of three called the <b>triplet code</b></li></ul>
    <p>During transcription, only <b>one DNA strand</b> is being transcribed</p>
    <ul><li>Known as the template strand (also known as the noncoding strand, minus strand, or antisense strand)</li></ul>
    <p>mRNA molecules formed are antiparallel and complementary to the DNA nucleotides.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Base pairing: A=U and C=G</li>
        <li>The mRNA nucleotide triplets are called codons</li>
        <ul><li>Codons code for amino acids</li></ul>
    </ul>
    <p>64 different codon combinations</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            61 code for amino acids</li>
        <li>
            3 are stop codons</li>
            <li>
                Universal to all life
                </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Redundancy</b>: more than one codon code for each amino acid</p>
    <p>Reading frame: the codons on the mRNA must be read in the correct groupings during translation to synthesize the correct proteins</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the reading frame shifts even by one letter, it will produce a completely different outcome</li>
    </ul>
